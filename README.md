# good-tweet
## What is this?
Sloppy little script to surface your cloutiest tweets from the tweet archive Twitter vends. Tweets are ranked by total number of favorites and retweets. That's it! Might not work if you are a big tweeter since it holds all of tweet.js in memory and does not use a fixed length priority queue. Whoops!

## How to run it
1. `npm i`
2. `npm run start <path to tweet.js>`
